# InsertionSort
This is a command line program demonstrating the insertion sort algorithm.

## Description

Sometimes it is difficult to visualize how sorting algorithms work. This program creates a random array of integers with a user defined array length and color-codes the sorted area on the left to show how the algorithm pick inserts the next value from the unsorted area on the right into the unsorted area.
